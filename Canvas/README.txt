CANVAS
This is what I have done for the canvas 
Im not sure if its what you all are looking for so I made a seperate folder 
The idea is similiar to the project display
make any changes as you please 
also this program is ran using OpenGl in visual studio 
header files needed to run canvas 
are:
#include <gl/glut.h>
#include <gl/gl.h>

Havent integrated because I want to discuss if its a
good approach!
